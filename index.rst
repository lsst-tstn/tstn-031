   This technote describes the steps required to execute Integration Milestone Pf. 
Some of the steps described here are required to setup the environment and won't need to be repeated on the verification step.

This milestone consists of driving the MTAOS to process simulated Corner Rafts data, compute the associated corrections and applying those corrections to the AOS components (Camera Hexapod, M2 Hexapod, M1M3 and M2).
After the process is completed the results are verified from a jupyter notebook.
